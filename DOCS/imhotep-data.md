## How to get access to the IMHOTEP data?
* The project is on-going and the IMHOTEP simulations are prepared and produced on Jean-Zay@IDRIS (french national HPC). The outputs are stored on Jean-Zay and reprensent ~200 To for WP1 (the global sensitivity runs).
* To get access to the data, contact first Thierry Penduff, William Llovel and Jean-Marc Molines. You'll then need to get an account at IDRIS and to communicate to jean-Marc your IDRIS login

## Nomenclature and documentation about the simulations:
* The technical doc and details on each simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/molines/IMHOTEP/tree/master/eORCA025),
* Here is a summary:

## Catalog of model output during WP1:
* A very raw catalog of data output produced during WP1 is available [here](/DOCS/output_catalog.md).
