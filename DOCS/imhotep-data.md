## How to get access to the IMHOTEP data?
* The project is on-going and the IMHOTEP simulations are prepared and produced on Jean-Zay@IDRIS (french national HPC). The outputs are stored on Jean-Zay and reprensent ~200 To for WP1 (the global sensitivity runs).
* To get access to the data, contact first Thierry Penduff, William Llovel and Jean-Marc Molines. You'll then need to get an account at IDRIS and to communicate to jean-Marc your IDRIS login
