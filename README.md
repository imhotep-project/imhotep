# [IMHOTEP]() in short:
* A project to study the ocean response (in ocean heat-salt contents and in regional sea level change) to variability in the continental freshwater discharge, over the altimetry Period.
* Principal investigators: 
    - PENDUFF Thierry (DR CNRS), Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement (IGE) Grenoble.
    - LLOVEL William (CR CNRS)
* Co-investigators from: IGE, Grenoble, LOPS, Brest,  IMT-Atlantique, Brest,  LEGOS, Toulouse	 and LOCEA, Paris.
* IMHOTEP is a project supported by the Ocean Surface Topography Science Team (OSTST) - EUMETSAT/CNES JRA  for 2021-2024. 
* Summary: In [IMHOTEP](), we aim to study the ocean response to time-variations of the  freshwater discharge. We focus on the north/tropical Atlantic and Indian oceans, which receive large amounts of continental freshwater. We aim to isolate and quantify the response of the ocean through several aspects, among which: the response in the regional sea-level components (thermo-/halo-steric and manometric), in oceanic heat and freshwater contents, in water mass properties and regional-/basin-scale circulation.
We  take advantage of synergies between satellite/in situ observations and NEMO simulations. We have  set up and produced  five global 1/4º-resolution ocean-sea-ice simulations designed as sensitivity experiments where the different sources of freshwater are successively set to climatological and fully-variying. This will reveal the individual and cumulative impacts of these freshwater sources on the global ocean with a focus on the aforementioned regions, with direct outcomes for the interpretation of satellite and in situ observations.
